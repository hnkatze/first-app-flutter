## Introduction

Welcome to the Flutter First Steps Project! This project is a simple Flutter application developed as part of a codelab tutorial. It serves as an introduction to the basics of Flutter, demonstrating the core concepts and features that make Flutter a powerful framework for building cross-platform applications.

## Features

- Cross-platform: Runs on both Android and iOS.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Easily customizable and extendable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
- An IDE with Flutter support (VS Code, IntelliJ, Android Studio)
- An Android or iOS device/emulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hnkatze/first-app-flutter
   cd first-app-flutter
   ```

2. **Get the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Connect a device or start an emulator**.
2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

- **android/**: Contains the Android-specific configuration and code.
- **ios/**: Contains the iOS-specific configuration and code.
- **lib/**: Contains the Dart code for the application.
  - **main.dart**: The entry point for the application.
- **test/**: Contains the unit and widget tests.
- **pubspec.yaml**: The project's configuration file.

## Usage

To modify the app, edit the files in the `lib/` directory. The main file to start with is `main.dart`. You can add new features, update the UI, and customize the app as per your requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6. Open a pull request.
